## 💰 Payment Security

### **Verification Checks:**
```
1. Memo Format
   ✓ Development: VYLDO-* (min 10 chars)
   ✓ Production: VYLDO-{6hex}-{6hex}-{6digits}

2. Transaction Uniqueness
   ✓ Not used in any other order
   ✓ Database-level constraint
   ✓ Can reuse for same order (re-payment)

3. Blockchain Verification
   ✓ Transaction exists on Hive
   ✓ Sent to: vyldo-escrow
   ✓ Amount: Matches order total
   ✓ Memo: Matches generated memo
   ✓ Status: Confirmed

4. Amount Verification
   ✓ Exact match required
   ✓ No partial payments
   ✓ No overpayments

5. Escrow Account
   ✓ Must be vyldo-escrow
   ✓ No other accounts accepted
```

### **Anti-Scam Measures:**
```
❌ Fake transaction IDs → Blockchain check fails
❌ Reused transactions → Database check fails
❌ Wrong memos → Verification fails
❌ Wrong amounts → Amount check fails
❌ Wrong accounts → Escrow check fails
❌ Script attacks → All checks required
❌ Loop attempts → Unique constraints
```
