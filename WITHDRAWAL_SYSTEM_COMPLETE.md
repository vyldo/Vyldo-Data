### **Available Balance:**
```javascript
// From completed orders
const completedOrders = await Order.find({
  seller: req.user._id,
  status: 'completed'
});

const balance = completedOrders.reduce((sum, order) => {
  return sum + (order.sellerEarnings || 0);
}, 0);

// Shows in withdrawal page
Available Balance: 273.000 HIVE
```

### **Pending Withdrawals:**
```javascript
// From pending/in_progress withdrawals
const pendingAmount = withdrawals
  .filter(w => w.status === 'pending' || w.status === 'in_progress')
  .reduce((sum, w) => sum + w.amount, 0);

// Shows in withdrawal page
Pending Withdrawals: 50.000 HIVE
```

### **Total Withdrawn:**
