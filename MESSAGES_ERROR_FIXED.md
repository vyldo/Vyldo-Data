# ✅ Messages Error - FIXED!

## ❌ Error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: conv.unreadCount?.get is not a function
at Messages.jsx:125
```

## ✅ Solution:

### **Problem:**
```javascript
// ❌ Wrong (MongoDB Map doesn't work in JSON)
const unread = conv.unreadCount?.get(user?._id) || 0;
```

### **Fix:**
```javascript
// ✅ Correct (Access as object property)
const unread = conv.unreadCount?.[user?._id] || 0;
```

### **Why:**
- MongoDB stores `unreadCount` as Map type
- When sent to frontend as JSON, it becomes a plain object
- `.get()` method doesn't exist on plain objects
- Use bracket notation `[key]` instead
