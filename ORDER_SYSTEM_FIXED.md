## 👁️ Visibility Rules

### **Buyer (Order Creator):**
```
Can see:
- ✅ Pending orders
- ✅ Pending verification orders
- ✅ Active orders
- ✅ All their orders

Cannot see:
- ❌ Other buyers' orders
```

### **Freelancer (Seller):**
```
Can see:
- ✅ Active orders (payment verified)
- ✅ Delivered orders
- ✅ Completed orders

Cannot see:
- ❌ Pending orders (no payment)
- ❌ Pending verification (not verified yet)
```

### **Implementation:**
```javascript
// Backend route
router.get('/', protect, async (req, res) => {
  const query = {};
  
  if (type === 'buying') {
    // Buyer sees all their orders
    query.buyer = req.user._id;
  } 
  else if (type === 'selling') {
    // Seller sees only verified orders
    query.seller = req.user._id;
    query.status = { $nin: ['pending', 'pending_verification'] };
  }
  
  const orders = await Order.find(query);
});
```
