## 🔧 Technical Fixes

### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Deliver - Wrong format
const deliverMutation = useMutation(
  async (data) => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    // FormData causing issues
  }
);

// Accept - Wrong name
const completeMutation = useMutation(
  async () => await api.post(`/orders/${id}/complete`)
  // Wrong endpoint
);

// Cancel - Wrong method
const cancelMutation = useMutation(
  async () => await api.post(`/orders/${id}/cancel`, ...)
  // Should be PATCH
);
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Deliver - Correct format
const deliverMutation = useMutation(
  async () => {
    return await api.post(`/orders/${id}/deliver`, {
      message: deliveryMessage,
      files: fileUrls
    });
  },
  {
    onSuccess: () => { /* ... */ },
    onError: (error) => {
      alert(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to deliver');
    }
  }
);

// Accept - Correct endpoint
const acceptMutation = useMutation(
  async () => await api.patch(`/orders/${id}/accept`),
  {
    onSuccess: () => { /* ... */ },
    onError: (error) => {
      alert(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to accept');
    }
  }
);

// Cancel - Correct method
const cancelMutation = useMutation(
  async () => await api.patch(`/orders/${id}/cancel`, {
    reason: cancelReason
  }),
  {
    onSuccess: () => { /* ... */ },
    onError: (error) => {
      alert(error.response?.data?.message || 'Failed to cancel');
    }
  }
);
